## Guess the NBA Player

Found in shiny-app, this is a simple game based on a recent trend in videos of people guessing players based on their stats. I had first seen Jeff Passan doing it with baseball players and felt inspired to create an application that allows users to play the same game endlessly, without anyone having to set it up for them. The app runs on Shiny Apps at: https://austinbarish.shinyapps.io/nbaguesser/. It uses the data collected in [./code/stats-import.ipynb](./code/stats-import.ipynb).

## basketball.py

This is a *work in progress* streamlit application, attempting to replicate [David Mezzetti's embedding search with baseball players](https://medium.com/neuml/explore-baseball-history-with-vector-search-5778d98d6846).
